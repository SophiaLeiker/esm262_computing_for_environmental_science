#Pb=crolling∗m∗g∗V+12∗A∗pair∗cdrag∗V3

#where crolling and cdrag are rolling and aerodynamic resistive coefficients, typical values are 0.015 and 0.3, respectively.

#V: is vehicle speed (assuming no headwind) in m/s (or mps) m: is vehicle mass in kg

#A is surface area of car (m2)

#g: is acceleration due to gravity (9.8m/s2)

#p_air = density of air (1.2kg/m3)

#Pb is power in Watts
